## Predicting Heart Disease competition on DrivenData.org


This is an R Markdown document that will be my inital attempt at a few things in R including:  
* Setting up an environment in R Studio  
* Working in R markdown with proper documentation  
* Extract, transform, and load data  
* Working with data.table, NOT data.frame  
* EDA  
* Some maching learning  
* Exporting the format correctly for the competition  

The link below is to the competition:

## Importing and transforming the data

First importing data as data.frames, converting to data.tables and then merge on patient_id to have a single table.

I spent a few hours chasing my tail due to my confusion between tables and frames.  Frames are default, but tables may be faster.  I have a cheatsheet for data.tables.

Taking a few minutes to view the summary statistics for anything that pops out.  So far, it looks like gender is worth digging into.

```{r}
library(data.table)
train_labels <- read.csv('train_labels.csv')
train_values <- read.csv('train_values.csv')
merged_train <- merge(train_labels, train_values, by = "patient_id")
DT <- as.data.table(merged_train)
summary(DT)

sapply(DT, class)
```


# Gender comparison plot

Using ggplot2 we can build a baseline predictive model based on gender alone. It appears that of people with heart disease (n=80), almost 70 are men.  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# add labels to this graph
library(ggplot2)
gender_plot <- ggplot(DT, aes(sex, heart_disease_present)) + geom_bar(stat = 'identity')
plot(gender_plot)
# add labels to the graph left side female, right side male
gender_plots <- ggplot(DT, aes(heart_disease_present)) + geom_bar() + facet_grid(~ sex)
plot(gender_plots)
```

## Several plots versus age.  Heart disease present showed a few interesting areas to explore.

```{r echo=FALSE}
cholesterol_plot <- ggplot(DT, aes(x = age, y = serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl, color = heart_disease_present)) + geom_point()
cholesterol_plot

resting_bp_plots <- ggplot(DT, aes(x = age, y = resting_blood_pressure, color = heart_disease_present)) + geom_point()
resting_bp_plots

max_hr_plot <- ggplot(DT, aes(x = age, y = max_heart_rate_achieved, color = heart_disease_present)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
max_hr_plot

angina_plot <- ggplot(DT, aes(x = exercise_induced_angina)) + geom_bar(aes(age), color = "Blue") + facet_wrap(~heart_disease_present)
angina_plot
```

## Need to look up corrpolt for the plot of the correlation matrix that was made.

```{r, echo = TRUE}

library("corrplot")
cor_variables <- merge(c(DT[,2:3]), c(DT[,5:15]))
cor_matrix <- round(cor(cor_variables), 3)
corrplot(cor_matrix, type = "upper")

```
# Histograms of various categorical data - tried to find a way to feed a vector and/or use lapply, but was unable to do so.  saved a variable called "categorical_variables"

* I also need to label these better and possible try to find a way to loop these.

```{r, echo= FALSE}
hist(DT$exercise_induced_angina)
hist(DT$resting_ekg_results)
hist(DT$num_major_vessels)
hist(DT$chest_pain_type)
hist(DT$slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment)
hist(DT$resting_blood_pressure)
hist(DT$fasting_blood_sugar_gt_120_mg_per_dl)
hist(DT$serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl)
hist(DT$oldpeak_eq_st_depression)
hist(DT$age)
hist(DT$max_heart_rate_achieved)
```
